# 🎙️ Speaker Notes (Teleprompter Version)

*Read this at a natural, conversational pace.*

**[0:00 - Intro]**

"Hi everyone. This is SignalDock."

"We all know tools like IFTTT or Zapier. They're great, but they live in the cloud. They can't see what's happening on your actual computer."

"SignalDock is different. It's a local-first automation engine that runs right here, on your metal. It monitors your CPU, your Battery, your Network, and even your Clipboard... in real-time."

---

**[0:25 - The visual Editor]**

"Let me show you how it works."

"This is the Pipeline Editor. It's completely visual. On the left, I have my Signal Sources. I can drag in a 'CPU Monitor' or a 'Window Watcher'."

"But let's build something useful right now. I'm going to grab the **Clipboard Source**."

---

**[0:45 - Building "Clipboard Spy"]**

"Now, I want to know every time I copy something. So I'll drag in a **Notification Action**."

"I just connect the two dots... just like that."

"I'll configure the notification to say: 'New Copy Detected', and I'll inject the actual text I copied dynamically."

"I hit Save... and it's live."

---

**[1:10 - The Demo]**

"Now watch this. I'll highlight this text here... hit Control-C..."

*(Pause for effect)*

"...and boom. Instant feedback. No API calls, no latency. It just works."

---

**[1:30 - The Matrix (Test Script)]**

"And for the developers out there, we give you full access to the signal stream."

"Here in the terminal, you can see the engine tracking memory usage, network traffic, and system flags milliseconds after they happen."

"This is the power of local automation."

---

**[1:50 - Outro]**

"SignalDock is open source and available on GitHub right now."

"Download it, run it, and start automating your workspace today."

"Thanks for watching."
